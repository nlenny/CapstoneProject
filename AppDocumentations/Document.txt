he application in the WPF should worked as follow for this iteration:
-Be able to provide locations for multiple addresses
-Give directions from one State to another
-the interface should Works for Toll Road, Round trips
-Show all icon for any computer

This is the issue I find so far in this iteration:
-It only gives the directions for the nearby states and also depends on locatio\
n
-Doesnt work for Toll road, and round trips yet.
- Couldnt show all Icon for every computer
- When clicking the get settings button it gives you multiple windows whcich sh\
ould happen


Future plan:
-To try to figure out how to make it works for every states
- Work for Toll Road and Round trip
- Fix the resolution issue
